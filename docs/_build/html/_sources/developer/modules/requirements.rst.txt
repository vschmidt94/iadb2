Requirements App
================

The Requirements App provides functionality for:
 * Defining Standards
 * Requirements
    Note: Requirements was previously known as "clauses" in original IADB Access
    Database. IADB2 abstracts this concept slightly to "requirements" as the 
    design should support Standards other than AS9100, in which case the
    organization may be different, etc.
