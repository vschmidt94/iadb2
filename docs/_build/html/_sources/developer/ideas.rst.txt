Developer Scratchpad
====================

TODO's 
------
Things I'm pretty sure need to happen / the work backlog

* Employee class
  Then modify Auditor class.  All auditors are employees, so pull userid, email from there
* Extend admin interface to app-specific versions.
  Go ready danjo docs on this and then look for examples in other books.
* Why is Sphinx CSS not working now?


Nice-to-have TODO's
-------------------
Not show-stoppers

* Need to figure out how to get code todo's hooked up in sphinx!
* Sphinx code highlighting is bad - can't seem to over-ride

Ideas
-----
My informal thoughts, ideas, suggestions, etc. for this project.  

* Implement in-app ticket system to replace this and be more useful for users to report
  issues. Django-helpdesk could be option once it supports Django 2
* Document substantial differences between iadb1 vs iadb2
  * Requirements vs Clauses and idea that coverage can trace to children, be covered by
    parent.
* Special Focus requirement. See end of 5.3 - how to handle?
* IS_TRAINING flag on things that can be used for training and should be cleaned up
* Store questions with audit, then parent can always be changed


Parent-child relationship for models:

May be useful in requirements

Requirement coverage choices: Self, Parent, Child, N/A ?  (and maybe Special)
