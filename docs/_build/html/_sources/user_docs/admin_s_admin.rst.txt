Administrative Super Powers
===========================

Administrators have access to a second database interface via the 
`Super Powers` menu option. 

Administrator Role
------------------
Users with Administrator role/authority will have additional controls
available in their user interface that allow for greater ability to make changes,
edits, corrections, etc. to the underlying data.

.. Danger::
   *Here there be dragons!*

   Using the Super Powers > Database Maintenance interface for data changes
    may **NOT** have the logic needed to keep you from shooting yourself in the foot.

   Anyone using this interface should be extremely thoughtful and
   deliberate on their actions.
