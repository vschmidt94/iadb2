39,Documented Information,1,TRUE,AS9100:D,"This process was last audited in 2017 Q1.  During review for Clause Coverage, noted that audit did not indicate any coverage of 7.5 (becaause all questions were aligned to 4.4.2 a and b, and because team overall was gaining knowledge and skills to audit to AS9100:2017).  Further, in reviewing the questions asked, it was observed that the specific AS9100:2017 clauses for 7.5 were covered as indicated in notes fields on each of the audit questions.  There is no need to repeat this audit in 2017 to ensure compliance."
40,Internal Audit,1,TRUE,AS9100:D,"A review of clause coverage for 2017 showed that not all clauses of 9.2 were covered during the internal audit of the Internal Audit programme. While the 2017 internal audit was appropriate for ACME Co.'s needs, it is equally important to ensure on-going conformance to sectoin 9.2 as a whole.  Accordingly, added additional audit of Internal Audit process in Q1 2018 with specific request to focus on compliance to the details of 9.2."
