Internal Audit Database (IADB2)
-------------------------------

IADB2 was / is a side project to POC some ideas on building an application to support internal audit processes.

The git repo here is an attempted resurrection of the project as it stood in 2019-2020.

If I had to do over in 2024, I would probably use a different stack, but wanted to pull this one out of the bin to use as possible reference.

While I'm not actively working on this project, audit proceedures, documentation, and the like are always of interest to me.
